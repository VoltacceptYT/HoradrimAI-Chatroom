### Server Storage
\`\`\`javascript
// Server structure
{
  id: "server_123",
  name: "My Server",
  description: "Server description",
  ownerId: "username",
  memberCount: 5,
  inviteCode: "ABC12345",
  isPublic: false
}

// Member structure
{
  serverId: "server_123",
  userId: "username",
  userEmail: "user@example.com",
  role: "owner" | "admin" | "member",
  joinedAt: timestamp
}
\`\`\`

### Message Storage
